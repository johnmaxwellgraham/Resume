              <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>Being from Minnesota I am a die hard Vikings fan. I bleed purple and gold and would give my brothers first born to see them in the SuperBowl. I am married with no children but we have a total of 20 legs in our house. 2 dog, 2 cats. Pigeon, Pluto, Lulu, and
            the baby boy Fletch. I love traveling and trying new things. I hope to be checking of Tokyo and Hong Kong off my travel list soon. One thing I am very proud of is owning my own home. It is something that took a lot of time, hard work, and dedication
            to make it happen.
